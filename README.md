# README
Please personally request access to any projects listed on my resume. All projects are currently private to promote selective collaboration
and protect my intellectual property as a Software Engineering Candadite.

I currently maintain a total of nine distinct private repositories. I am willing to grant access to all these repositories, irrespective of their inclusion on my resume, to those expressing interest.
